# Install Node.js and npm
brew install node

# Install Next.js globally
npm install -g create-next-app
```

### Windows

```bash
# Install Node.js and npm (using Chocolatey)
choco install nodejs

# Install Next.js globally
npm install -g create-next-app
```

### Linux

## Installing PostgreSQL on macOS, Windows, and Linux

### macOS

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL using Homebrew
brew install postgresql
```

### Windows

Download the PostgreSQL installer from [PostgreSQL official site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) and follow the installation wizard.

### Linux

## Interaction: Database Setup

Now that we have Next.js and PostgreSQL installed let's set up our PostgreSQL database.

### macOS, Windows, and Linux

1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Log in to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres

# Create a new database and user
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
CREATE USER myuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'mypassword';
ALTER ROLE myuser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE myuser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE myuser SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;
\q
```
